<p><strong>PANIO</strong> is a combination of three words: <strong>PAN I</strong>nteroperable <strong>O</strong>rthodontics. <em>pan</em> is greek for "all", so PANIO stands for "All Interoperable Orthodontics", as its goal is to solve the informatics interoperability issues that have always existed between orthodontic software.</p>
