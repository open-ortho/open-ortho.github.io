Whether you are teaching or learning at an academic institution, here is what you can do.

Considering today's technology, in an ideally configured orthodontic practice:

- you will never have to enter patient data more than once;
- the central location of patient data will never be manually managed in file system folders. When your central repository of data is a file system folder, you are bound to loose data;
- you will always have the ability to export your patient's data in either DICOM or HL7 format;
- you will always have the ability to access, manipulate and run calculations on your patients raw data. Although you personally will probably never need to do this, you do want to have the possibility of hiring a third party to help you with this, in case you need some kind of functionality that your software is not able to achieve.

If the practice you work in does not have all of these abilities, their system could be improved.

## Learners

If you are a student, this is the time for you to learn. One thing you absolutely need to learn are the basics of clinical data, and how it should be managed in your practice. You need to know what you want and know how to ask for it. 

You want integration, you want to be able to connect all of the products you are using and will be using together in a sustainable way. You don't want to have to deal with mediocre compromises of often partial proprietary interoperability. In order to do so, you need to know that there is a better way.

Finding an answer to these questions will help you prepare for when you will need to setup your own practice:

1. Is there a [DICOM PACS server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system) at your school? What is it used for? A PACS server is essentially a central location medical grade storage for all of your medical images (2D and 3D, including Photography) in [DICOM](https://dicomstandard.org) format.
1. How are the photographs acquired and stored? Do they go in the PACS? Why not?
1. What is the main central system for patient data? Is it the practice management system?
1. When you are using another program, one that is not the main one, do you have to manually create the patient there, even though it already exists in the main system?
    - If so, why?
    - If not, what is basic mechanism that allows this to happen? If you wanted to replicate it in your own practice, what are the questions you would need to ask a software vendor to make it happen?

## Teachers

As a university professor, there are various things that you can do, which will help with the adoption of open-standards:

1. Find out the answers to same questions above.
2. Find out what is missing for the clinic of your institution to achieve the ideal situation described at the beginning of this page.
