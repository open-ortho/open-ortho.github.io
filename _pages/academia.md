## Learners

If you are a student, this is the time for you to learn. One thing you absolutely need to learn are the basics of clinical data, and how it should be managed in your practice. You need to know what you want and know how to ask for it. 

You want integration, you want to be able to connect all of the products you are using and will be using together in a sustainable way. You don't want to have to deal with mediocre compromises of often partial proprietary interoperability. In order to do so, you need to know that there is a better way.
