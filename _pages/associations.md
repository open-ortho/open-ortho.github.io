Associations and foundations play a fundamental role in the implementation of open-standard based interoperability. By promoting and supporting the usage of open standards, 

1. developers can grain greater visibility
2. developers may have a greater incentive to make use of open standards
3. medical providers could more knowledge about the existence and benefits of open standards

Things that associations and foundations can do:

## Interoperability Showcases

## Project funding

If a foundation is providing funding for specific innovation or research projects, in the application form a requirement for making use of open standards to import and export data could be added. This alone would be of almost zero cost to the foundation, yet provide a huge drive for applicants to implement standards.

The [NIH](https://datascience.nih.gov/fhir-initiatives) and the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22553/nsf22553.htm) have already started moving in this direction.

## Inform members

Articles in journal, morning huddle emails, courses and information booths at meetings.
