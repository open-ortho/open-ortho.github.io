Lack of open-standard based interoperability is common all over technology. But for non-medical fields, the impact on humanity is mostly low. For example, having to install and use a dozen different messaging apps (like WhatsApp, Messenger, Signal, Telegram, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Skype, Viber, iMessage, Google Duo, Zoom, Google Meet, etc) just to be able to keep in touch with all of our coworkers, friends and family is inconvenient, but ultimately we can have patience and live with it. 

However, the lack of widespread open-standard based interoperability is directly impacting research ([click here to see how](/why/research/)), which in turn is directly impacting medical progress, which, in turn, is directly impacting the health of humanity.

Similarly, wasting human resources to perform the same or similar tasks over and over again ([click here to see how](/why/wasted_hr/)), without actually any functional contribution to human society, will also, ultimately impact the health of humanity. This is because these resources are shared with the ones necessary for software development (bug fixes and new features).
