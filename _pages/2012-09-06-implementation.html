<p>Once a preliminary version of the standard has been approved, we plan to write an <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">open-source</a> implementation of it. This will serve various purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help divulge the standard by proving that it is functional.</li>
<li>Build a test application that will aid the testing and debugging of the standard. Every implementer and standard developer could use this application as a reference for functionality testing.</li>
<li>Provide the orthodontic community with a free package that will allow for basic patient database management operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The implementation will be in a <a class="zem_slink" title="Cross-platform" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">platform independent</a> language, such as <a class="zem_slink" title="Java (software platform)" href="http://www.java.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">JAVA</a> and most likely hosted on an open source repository site such as sourceforge.net.</p>
