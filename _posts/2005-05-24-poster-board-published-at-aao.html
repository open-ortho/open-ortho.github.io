<p><a href="http://projectpanio.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/version02f_small.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-115" title="PANIO: The First Orthodontic Standard (poster)" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2005/05/version02f_small.png" alt="" width="150" height="75" /></a>We have officially started the effort of defining an informatics standard for orthodontics, and have deadlines! We decided to divulge the news through a scientific posterboard at the biggest orthodontic convention in the world. Software vendors, doctors or anyone interested should know about this project.</p>
<p>Our posterboard got accept before we started to collaborate with the <a class="zem_slink" title="American Dental Association" href="http://www.ada.org/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">American Dental Association</a> (ADA) Standards Committee for Dental Informatics (SCDI). What this means is that the course of the prject changed quite a bit from when we wrote the initial abstract for the poster until when it was up on display. The title of the project, for instance, probably would have never been <em>PANIO</em> had I been introduced to the ADA SCDI earlier. But we figured <em>PANIO</em> actually sounded pleasing to the ear in all languages, and that we should therefore take advantage of this opportunity and keep the name.</p>
<p>The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2005/05/version02f_small.png">scientific poster</a> occupies the full 8'x4' provided tackboard. It provides the viewer with a broad perspective of what a software standard is and why it is needed in the field of orthodontics. At it's center there is a description of the ADA SCDI and <a class="zem_slink" title="DICOM" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">DICOM</a> structures. This part was influenced by the newly established collaboration with them.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://projectpanio.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/output.pdf">PANIO: The First Orthodontic Standard (handout)</a> was provided for the more interested. All four sides of the handout were printed on a single Letter size booklet, and provided the reader with a little extra information such as references, more names on collaborators and more detail on the individual working groups.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p><!--more--><a class="zem_slink" title="Computer standard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_standard" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Software standards</a> are becoming increasingly popular in the medical<br />
field, reducing the risk of patient data loss and allowing for greater<br />
patient data interchange. Many medical fields have either already<br />
developed or are currently developing standards like DICOM and ADA<br />
SCDI. Yet there still exists no software standard in the orthodontic<br />
field. Our goal is to develop a public orthodontics software standard,<br />
approved by clinicans, developers and accredited instututions<br />
worldwide. In collaboration with: ADA and DICOM.</p>
<p>Plan: 1) extend DICOM to accommodate all orthodontics data needs. 2)<br />
Include the instructions of the extended DICOM standard in an ADA<br />
Techincal Report; 3) prove the functionality of the standard by writing<br />
a program that directly implements it. The final products (all standard<br />
definitions and the implemented software) are meant to be pucliblicly<br />
available free of charge to facilitate their distribution. We hope our<br />
presentation will stimulate interest among individuals and institutions<br />
to joins us in this project.</p>
