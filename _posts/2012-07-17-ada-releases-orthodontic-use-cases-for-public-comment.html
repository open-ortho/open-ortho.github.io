<p>The <a class="zem_slink" title="American Dental Association" href="http://www.ada.org/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">American Dental Association</a> Standards Committee for <a class="zem_slink" title="Health informatics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Dental Informatics</a> has just released one of the milestones for the development of an informatics standard that will allow all <a class="zem_slink" title="Orthodontics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">orthodontic</a> related software to inter-operate. One of the first steps is to develop a set of use-cases. These act like small storyboards and serve the purpose of identifying what actually needs to get standardized.</p>
<p>Anyone can go to their website, read the draft, ask for the full document for free, and make comments by following the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://sitescape.ada.org/scdi/scdi/dispatch.cgi/public/showFolder/100377">All Interested Parties Review for Proposed ADA Technical Report No. 1065 for Use Cases of the Orthodontic Electronic Health Record</a></p>
<p>Now that these use-cases are here and ADA approved, it will be possible to investigate current standards, such HL7 and DICOM, to find out if they are fit for these use-cases.</p>
