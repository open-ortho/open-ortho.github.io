Today, orthodontists should not need to burden their work load with tasks such as figuring out how to send
patient information to colleagues or how to share the same patient record across different software
programs. In a long-term attempt to lighten these tasks, we are developing a standard for electronic
orthodontic patient records to enable a seamless interchange of data between software programs. This
article describes a practical proposal that integrates 2 existing standards, HL7 and DICOM, to create a
standard for electronic orthodontic patient records. (Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop 2007;132:116-21)
