# Software interoperability for Orthodontics

## Scope/Mission

Our mission is to bring real interoperability to the people in the orthodontic
domain.


## The Problem

![Two medical staff members can't connect their devices together, because they plugs are not compatible](./assets/img/NoOrthoCompatibility_Plug.jpg "No Compatibility")

As of 2021, it is astoundingly still very difficult to set up two or more orthodontic software products to communicate with each other.

## Values

We envision a world where 
* the orthodontic provider can pick and choose whatever software suits their need to accomplish whatever task they need to accomplish without having to worry about data conversion, importing or bridging.
* the orthodontic software developer can easily bridge with other systems by implement open standards without requiring private consultants or long hours for understanding standard documentation.
* both the orthodontic software developer and the orthodontic provider don't need keep spending time and resources for data conversion or custom integrations.
* Small-scoped software products can enter the private practice of the orthodontic-provider seamlessly.

## Our Projects

* [dicom4ortho](https://github.com/open-ortho/dicom4ortho): A Python library to create fully defined orthodontic photographs in DICOM.
* [dcm4ceph](https://github.com/open-ortho/dcm4ceph): Convert Cephalograms from JPEG to DICOM. Cephalograms are 2D radiographs of the cranium, taken by following standards which allow providers to take measurements and make clinical decisions from them.
